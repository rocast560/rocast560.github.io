Hello, this is my blog site where I plan to post about my journey with cyber defense/red teaming competitions, software engineering activities and some game hacking stuff, nothing post worthy at the moment but maybe soon. Might even add some clips of me rock climbing even though this is a technical blog. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
